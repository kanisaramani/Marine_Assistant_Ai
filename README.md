🌊 Marine Heatwave & Coral Bleaching AI Assistant

This is a lightweight, explainable AI tool that analyzes Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies to estimate the risk of coral bleaching — and provides natural language explanations using a domain-aware language model.

> Built in under a day using Python, Streamlit, and Hugging Face Transformers 🚀

---

🔍 What It Does

- ✅ Loads ocean temperature anomaly data (CSV)
- ✅ Classifies coral bleaching risk as Low / Moderate / High
- ✅ Uses an LLM to explain the risk in plain language
- ✅ Presents all results in an interactive Streamlit dashboard
